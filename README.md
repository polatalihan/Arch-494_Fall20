# < What >
This course will investigate urban data & spatial relationships and how they affect multiple subject areas, from the way how cities shape to how their inhabitants behave. Our cities are functioning mechanisms with a series of systems. The objective of the course is to identify and deep-dive into these systems, use “open-data” platform and gather data to understand the realm of “urban”. How does “food deserts” form in urban areas, why can’t we build more “affordable housing”, can we predict and track “gentrification”? By using GIS tools and software, students will develop mapping projects and learn to gather, analyze and visualize data on existing relations between the social and spatial.
# < Why >
Mapping brings together the Urban and the Architectural scales through a series of data abstractions and sets of rules. Students are asked to focus on developing a visual language to discuss, collect, measure and quantify city behaviors/patterns using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as their main tool. They will respond to the literal and symbolic notion of “Motus” in the city, and create mappings, diagrams and data visualizations. 
The class will discuss & highlight 
•	Importance of “Open-Data” Platforms and “Why we need them?”
•	Differences of a dataset, a database and spatial data?
•	How to read / understand urban data?
•	Storyboarding through data
•	Tools & methods available to <_______________↓> data

# < How >
In 2019 alone, there were 56,654 traffic accidents recorded in LA. In 2018 a total of 1,680,060,402 metrocard swipes were recorded at NYC Subway. The parking meter Id# E-1515 at E Street and 16th Street Intersection at San Diego collected $450 on 6/3/2019 achieving highest daily transaction in 2019. These are just facts, numbers let alone do only speak to a limited audience. The class will investigate the ways which tabular and numeric data about people, behavior and urban infrastructure can be used to tell stories and construct a framework for design.

# < Learning Outcomes >

Employ modes of architectural representation and other discipline-specific vocabulary and analytic systems
o	From a selection of drawings, physical and digital models, written statements and oral presentations students will demonstrate competency in architectural representation

Situate architecture within historic, social and cultural contexts
o	Students will produce work (such as short essays, structured class discussions, presentations, original research papers) using the methods of the history and theory of architecture

Assert a critical position through the development of an architecture thesis
o	In their architecture thesis projects or original papers students will formulate a research question; collect and select relevant information; distinguish their authorial voice from that of their sources; draw a conclusion or a thesis that conveys the complexity of the researched topic and takes a position; substantiate their position by deploying evidence; present the position in a clearly organized and persuasive prose and/or graphic presentation

GRADING/ASSIGNMENTS
Participation (Q&A and Lectures) 10%
Reading Presentations 15%
Assignments & Portfolio 20% 
Midterm Paper 20%
Final Project 35%


Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. This includes all scheduled classes, lectures, field trips, meetings and presentations, whether on campus or not. Attendance is imperative for the successful completion of this course. Absences of any kind will have a direct impact on the Class Participation portion of the grade, as it is impossible to contribute to, or benefit from, any intellectual discourse and exchange without being present.

If you foresee not being able to attend class, please NOTIFY me in advance through email or slack. Every absence MUST be substantiated by a serious personal reason, such as illness. Each unexcused absence will result in a direct deduction of your grade, at a rate of 5% each. More than three unexcused absences can result in receiving an incomplete grade for the term.

Due Dates
All assigned work is due as per the attached Schedule, unless advised otherwise by the instructor. Late work (i.e. all work submitted after due dates) will be penalized a minimum of one letter grade per week, starting the day the work is late. There will not be “make-up” work associated with this course. 


Portfolio & Deliverables 
Each student should document all exercises done in class and materials presented at final project review in terms of raw data, analyzed / edited data and final visuals. All submitted presentation files should be in PDF format with high resolution suitable for large scale printing if necessary (min 150 dpi – ideal 300 dpi). A shared dropbox or slack folder for the class will be created for you to begin saving your work throughout the semester. A Single assembled and formatted PDF document will be submitted at the end of semester by each student. The format and layout will be discussed in class. 

Academic Integrity
Every effort will be made to provide an enjoyable and optimal learning environment for this course, in an atmosphere of free inquiry and expression. Students need to read and understand the University’s Academic Integrity Policy. Plagiarism and cheating are not tolerated. You cannot use other people’s ideas or writings without proper attribution, including any information from the web. When in doubt, cite your source. It is very important that you learn to use references ethically. It is your responsibility to maintain the university’s highest ethical standards.

Design Studio Requirements
Each session will start with a brief discussion about the subject, so please do not be late. Some classes may begin with a brief lecture or an individual/team presentation about readings. Second half of the class time will be hands on experience with open-data tools. Pin-ups will occur as needed. If there are no lectures/presentations scheduled, each student is expected to be working on their final project idea. During that time the instructor will come around and speak with each person individually or with their group, if applicable. You are required to speak with the instructor about the progress of your work. You are also highly encouraged to take advantage of the available office hours for additional discussion.

Students are required to be in the class during ALL of the assigned class hours. Unexcused absences, failure to participate in team and desk discussions, “pin-up” and public reviews may result in grade loss. Student who are absent more than three times without an acceptable excuse, or who fail to present their Midterm papers or Final presentations will be asked to withdraw from the class.

The class rules are as follows: no cell phones or loud music during class hours; no disruptive behavior or excessive traffic, no discussions outside of the work of the class that will become a distraction for others; please try to make an efficient use of your time in order to complete the assigned work within the time frame of the class.

All students should feel free to take full advantage of the class time as an exceptional learning environment. The intense interaction and camaraderie that can develop in the studio setting promotes a higher level of learning for the individual and teams alike. Since it is a “shared space”, the needs and actions of both individuals and groups working in the studio need to be balanced and tempered with respect, common courtesy, and good sense. Please let the Instructor know if there are problems or issues which cannot be resolved on your own.
